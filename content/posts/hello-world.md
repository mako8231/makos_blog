Hello! My name is Masao but I pefer to be called as "Mako" ^^, and welcome to my blog!

### And Why I created this?

The goal of this blog is to archive my projects's development process. This is a fun way to me to keep on track of my journey as a developer. 

### How'd I got into this?

Since my 14's I got into programming through a techincal course on high school. I got started with Portugol (for those who aren't Brazilian, is a pseudo-code written in Portuguese). 

```c
Algoritmo "hello world"
var 

Inicio
escreval("Hello World") //This is a portugol (VisualAlg) program.
FinalAlgoritmo
```

I really enjoyed messing up with that ðŸ˜… after that I delved into C#:

```C#
//WHAT IS THIS????
using System;
//CLASS? CLASS WHO????? 
class Program
{
    //WHO IS VOID I'M BRASILEIRA NAO CAN'T READ!!!
    static void Main()
    {
        //WHO IS CONSOLE? PLAYSTATION????
        Console.WriteLine("Abandon all hope when enter here, Portugol Developer!");
    }
}

```

And I was like ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ WTF!!??? Personally I would have perferred to start with C before all that **(EVEN I DIDN'T KNEW A THING ABOUT THAT ONE TOO)**, lmao! Well, following that, I studyied Java and I learned a lot about OOP making simple projects, and learned things about MYSQL too (Hybernate said hello). 

```java
//Okay.... Class is a sort of Object model... Right?
public class HelloWorld {
    //Public is... how external objects access things... 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //This is how you call OS instruction... right?
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

At the end of course ... Anyways, I got into Golang as a initiative to learn by myself some programming concepts, I made a very crappy bot and it was go through after countless updates, rewritting, and it was a project that I even got a help with a skilled friend.

Besides that project, I got into game development early too. My first game engine I've worked on and making silly projects was Game Maker **Lite**, yeah.
