Hello! My name is Masao but I pefer to be called as "Mako" ^^, and welcome to my blog!

### And Why I created this?

The goal of this blog is to archive my projects's development process. This is a fun way to me to keep on track of my journey as a developer. 

### How'd I got into this?

Since my 14's I got into programming through a techincal course on high school. I got started with Portugol (for those who aren't Brazilian, is a pseudo-code written in Portuguese). 

```c
Algoritmo "hello world"
var 

Inicio
escreval("Hello World") //This is a portugol (VisualAlg) program.
FinalAlgoritmo
```

I really enjoyed messing up with that ðŸ˜… after that I delved into C#:

```C#
//WHAT IS THIS????
using System;
//CLASS? CLASS WHO????? 
class Program
{
    //WHO IS VOID I'M BRASILEIRA NAO CAN'T READ!!!
    static void Main()
    {
        //WHO IS CONSOLE? PLAYSTATION????
        Console.WriteLine("Abandon all hope when enter here, Portugol Developer!");
    }
}

```

And I was like ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ WTF!!??? Personally I would have perferred to start with C before all that **(EVEN I DIDN'T KNEW A THING ABOUT THAT ONE TOO)**, lmao! Well, following that, I studyied Java and I learned a lot about OOP making simple projects, and learned things about MYSQL too (Hybernate said hello). 

```java
//Okay.... Class is a sort of Object model... Right?
public class HelloWorld {
    //Public is... how external objects access things... 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //This is how you call OS instruction... right?
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

At the end of course ... Anyways, I got into Golang as a initiative to learn by myself some programming concepts, I made a very crappy bot and it was go through after countless updates, rewritting, and it was a project that I even got a help with a skilled friend.

<!--Put your own art here dummy-->

Besides that project, I got into game development early too. My first game engine I've worked on and making silly projects was Game Maker **Lite**, yeah. And I coded something? Nah, I just stuffed a bunch of events and made the most atrocious thing that was ever made, and sadly I don't have the project... Because it was hilarious.

Subsequently, I started to using RPG Maker VX Ace, I did a lot of cringy stuff and I'll elaborate any futher. But I got the first grasp of OOP, even not knowing much about Ruby and it's scripting language (RGSS). 

Everything went cold about game development until 2017~2018, the year that I discovered Godot... 

[Picture about godot]

In the meantime, I studied pixel art. While digging around, I stumbled upon a Reimu artwork:

And some animation:

About the time studying a lot of GDscript and Pixel art, I finally made a project that was made with my very own art ðŸ˜Š

Sadly I don't have any other images... But I think I can find the whole project file, eventually I'll write about this project in particular, because it reached a very interesting maturing process. 

## And what now? 

Of course I've skipped a lot of projects, ideas and I just gave a brief introduction of myself. And I had going trought a lot a things, nowadays, I got a really liking into C/C++, yeah, I'm not saying that I became a huge fan of low level programming, but C really captivated me, the fact there's a old ass programming language that is still used util this day, have a high performance and a lot of control. 

I'm aiming to make simple games/tech demos using the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/), and documenting the whole process. The reason behind that is because I really liked using some frameworks like [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), etc. And I really want to know more about the whole engineiring the game development process. 

Some about some grammar crimes I might commited here... English is not my native language so this blog is also a way to improve my english writting as well XD.
